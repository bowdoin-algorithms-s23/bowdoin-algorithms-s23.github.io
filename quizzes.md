### Quizzes 

There will be approx. 10-11 quizzes quizzes this semester.  The quizzes are a combination of multiple-choice and short-answer questions that test the knowledge from lectures and labs. Expect them to be short and focused on the specific topic discussed that week. Youâ€™ll take the quizzes remotely from your room. 

The quizzes along with their due dates will be released in Canvas.
