## Initial announcements, logistics, resources



Hi everyone, Welcome to Algorithms! 

This Github site hosts all _public_ resources for the class, such as syllabus, lecture notes, policies, etc.  In addition we'll use: 

* __Canvas__: The class  has  a _Canvas_ site, accessible through your Bowdoin portal, that hosts the online quizzes and other private resources we'll use throughout the semester. 

* __Gradescope__:  You'll use Gradescope to submit the assignments and to check the feedback you receive. Gradescope helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like anonymous grading.

* __Slack__: Class communication will be entirely on Slack. You will need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible cancellations and location changes (in case there are any). You can contact me and any of the LAs by private messaging on Slack. 

The link/code to join Gradescope/Slack are posted on Canvas.
