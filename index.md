## Welcome to Algorithms, spring 2023! 

This Github site hosts all _public_ resources for the class, such as syllabus, lecture notes, policies, etc.  In addition we'll use: 

* __Canvas__: The class  has  a _Canvas_ site, accessible through your Bowdoin portal, that hosts the online quizzes and other private resources. 

* __Gradescope__:  You'll use Gradescope for assignments. Gradescope helps streamline the process of submission, grading and returning feedback, and it is also useful for implementing practices like anonymous grading.

* __Slack__: Class communication will be entirely on Slack. You will need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible cancellations or delays. 

The link/code to join Gradescope/Slack are posted on Canvas.
