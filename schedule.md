| Week 1, 2, 3    |  Introduction and review (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, best case and worst cases analysis). Analysis tools (asymptotic notation, summations, recurrences). |                
| Week 4, 5, 6    | Efficient sorting (mergesort, heapsort,  quicksort, randomized quicksort). Sorting lower bound, bucket sort and counting sort. Selection (quick-select and O(n) worst-case selection) |                |              
| Week 7, 8, 9, 10  | Techniques (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming and greedy).  |                           
| Week 11, 12, 13 | Graphs basics, shortest paths (shortest paths on DAGs, Dijkstra's  and Bellman-Ford algorithms) and minimum spanning trees (Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms)|
