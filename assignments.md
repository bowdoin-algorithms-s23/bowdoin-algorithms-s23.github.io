### Assignments 


There will be roughly one assignment per week, and they will be released in Gradescope. 

__Partner optional:__  You may work with one partner (see course policies for details on what this means).   One member of the team should submit the assignment and should  add the other member to the "team" so that (s)he  can get the credit. 

__Honor code:__ Assignmentsare at collaboration-level 1; that is, verbal collaboration without solution sharing (check course policies for details on what this means).  There are lots of resources online, such as lecture notes, animations, visualizations, practice problems, video recordings, which you are encouraged to explore to help you understand the material. __However, you must be careful not to search the internet for specific problems with the intent to get hints for their solutions. Searching for the assignment problems on the internet violates academic honesty for this class.__


Remember the office hours and come talk to us. The homeworks are not exams—they are not there to test you— they are there to create opportunities to learn. We expect everyone to do well on the homework, and to take the time to write carefully.
